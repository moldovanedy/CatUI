# CatUI docs

Welcome to the CatUI documentation!

CatUI is a fast, cross-platform and easy-to-use UI framework for .NET. It is decoupled from native platform UI options
and instead uses SkiaSharp for rendering, meaning that the user interface will look exactly the same on all platforms
(Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android). Instead of using markup languages for creating the UI, CatUI follows a modern
approach of creating everything related to UI through C# code.

See [Overview](manual/overview.md) for the guiding manual that will help you create applications using CatUI.
